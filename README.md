# GameSave-Auto-Backup
Automatically backup game saves to a Google Drive folder to be accessed from anywhere.
Currently only working with The Sims 4 as a test.

Log in to desired Google Drive account and place exe in \Game\Bin next to ts4.exe

You currently must change the directory location of the included icon file to where ever you save this in order to compile.
