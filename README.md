# GameSave-Auto-Backup
Automatically backup game saves to a Google Drive folder to be accessed from anywhere.
Currently only working with The Sims 4 as a test.

Log in to desired Google Drive account and place exe in \Game\Bin next to ts4.exe

# Plans
Make usable for any user specified game and save to a file that can be loaded.
